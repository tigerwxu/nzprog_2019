A repository for problem statements, data and some of my mediocre solutions from NZPC 2019 that is mostly to practise using Git with GitHub.

All programs read from std.in and output to std.out. Output has to be checked manually against the data (unless you're OK trusting me saying that they are all correct), there is no marking/judge program.
